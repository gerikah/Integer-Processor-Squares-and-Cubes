# Open the input file 'integers.txt' in read mode
# Read the integers from the file and store them in a list
# Create two empty lists, even_integers and odd_integers
# Loop through the list of integers:
    # If the integer is even, append it to even_integers list
    # If the integer is odd, append it to odd_integers list
# Create two empty lists, squares and cubes
# Loop through the even_integers list:
    # Calculate the square of each integer and append it to squares list
# Loop through the odd_integers list:
    # Calculate the cube of each integer and append it to cubes list
# Open the first output file 'double.txt' in write mode
# Loop through the squares list:
    # Write each square to the file followed by a new line character
# Close the first output file
# Open the second output file 'triple.txt' in write mode
# Loop through the cubes list:
    # Write each cube to the file followed by a new line character
# Close the second output file
